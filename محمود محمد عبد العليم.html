<h2><font color ="green ">What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</font></h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. </p>
<h2><font color ="green ">WHY RESEARCH AI SAFETY? </font></h2>
<p>In the near term, the goal of keeping AI’s impact on society beneficial motivates research in many areas, from economics and law to technical topics such as verification, validity, security and control. Whereas it may be little more than a minor nuisance if your laptop crashes or gets hacked, it becomes all the more important that an AI system does what you want it to do if it controls your car, your airplane, your pacemaker, your automated trading system or your power grid. Another short-term challenge is preventing a devastating arms race in lethal autonomous weapons.

In the long term, an important question is what will happen if the quest for strong AI succeeds and an AI system becomes better than humans at all cognitive tasks. As pointed out by I.J. Good in 1965, designing smarter AI systems is itself a cognitive task. Such a system could potentially undergo recursive self-improvement, triggering an intelligence explosion leaving human intellect far behind. By inventing revolutionary new technologies, such a superintelligence might help us eradicate war, disease, and poverty, and so the creation of strong AI might be the biggest event in human history. Some experts have expressed concern, though, that it might also be the last, unless we learn to align the goals of the AI with ours before it becomes superintelligent.</p>
<h2><font color ="brown ">Artificial Intelligence’s Increasing Relevance</font></h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence’s growing popularity in the 21st century is largely due to the advancements in the sub-field of machine learning. Machine learning develops systems that improve upon themselves, which is accomplished through the identification of algorithms. Some processes that machine learning optimizes include paperwork automation, forensic accounting, and algorithmic trading.</p>
<h2><font color ="brown ">How is Machine Learning Achieved?</font></h2>
<p>The easiest way to understand how a machine becomes intelligent with AI is to compare it to how humans learn. For example, consider a child learning how to ride a bicycle. The child mounts the bicycle, grips the handlebars, and hopes to stay upright and in control. The child does not learn how to ride a bike by understanding the physics of biking, but rather through trial and error.

Over time, the child becomes instinctively adept in perceiving factors that can make him lose control of the bicycle. Just as a child learns the unwritten rules of riding a bicycle through practice, artificial intelligence is developed through repeated simulation.</p>
<h3><font color ="blue ">1. Supervised Learning</font></h3>
<p>Supervised learning is the most common learning method in the field of artificial intelligence. A machine attempts to derive a function given labeled sets of input and output pairs. When dealing with a numerical data set, regression is used. When dealing with categorical variables, classification is the preferred method. If the model provides an incorrect answer, the model can be adjusted to provide more accurate outputs.</p>
<h3><font color ="blue ">2. Unsupervised Learning</font></h3>
<p>Unsupervised learning involves a machine transforming data into useful information. Common methods include clustering and association. Clustering groups similar variables together, whereas association detects correlation among variables. Data mining utilizes clustering and association to filter through large data sets. The process of transforming large data sets into meaningful information can be optimized with unsupervised learning.</p>
<h3><font color ="blue ">3. Reinforcement Learning</font></h3>
<p>In reinforcement learning, a machine autonomously responds to external stimuli and is conditioned through occasional rewards and punishment. The purpose of the reinforcement learning method is to develop a machine that can act rationally on its own.

The large investment bank, J.P Morgan, currently uses reinforcement learning algorithms to place trades. This is accomplished through programming that accordingly awards or penalizes the algorithm depending on the decision made.</p>
<h2><font color ="brown ">Future Impact of Artificial Intelligence</font></h2>
<p>Rapid advances in artificial intelligence will result in a profound impact on productivity, employment, and competition. However, AI’s future integration into society is a controversial subjec </p>
<h3><font color ="blue ">Impact on Productivity</font></h3>
<p>Increasing economic productivity leads to more satisfied customers and strengthened corporate profitability. In the airline industry, AI will drive customer satisfaction through accurately scheduled and safer flights. Businesses that harness AI can improve their value proposition to customers while improving profitability at the same time.

For example, Delta Airlines leverages machine learning to provide its customers with superior flying experience. Delta analyzes Big Data to learn about aircraft positions, weather conditions, and aircraft diagnostics. Hypothetical outcomes and their probabilities are then identified. The airline then optimizes its flight scheduling with reference to the potential outcomes.</p>
<h3><font color ="blue ">Impact on Employment</font></h3>
<p>Rapid expansion in the artificial intelligence field will result in more high-paying jobs, which, in turn, will require more highly-educated employees. The largest criticism of AI is that it will automate low-skill jobs and increase the unemployment rate for less-educated people.

Furthermore, low-skilled employees are more likely to be minorities, due to systematic discrimination. It is, therefore, argued that artificial intelligence can reinforce systematic discriminatory practices.</p>
<h3><font color ="blue ">Impact on Competition</font></h3>
<p>Companies attempting to achieve a competitive advantage can leverage AI to optimize their business. Currently, only innovators and a few early adopters are integrating AI into their businesses. Once the economic benefit of AI integration outweighs the R&D and integration costs, more companies will adopt the new technology.

Assume a toy manufacturer decides to use machine learning to further optimize its supply chain. The manufacturer can take advantage of its lowered cost of goods sold and offer toys at a lower price point to capture market share. This demonstrates how AI can increase competitive behavior in the marketplace.</p>
